# About the project
Portfolio created to **share my projects and work tools**. Additionally, this project was **my first time using Next.js (and React as well) and Framer Motion**. I believe the code is not exactly clean and well-structured, but I did my best.

One of the difficulties I faced was trying to understand the famous Hooks and the re-renders they trigger. It's also worth mentioning that I had some trouble deploying to Vercel. One of the issues was capitalization in file names. Some folders and files had uppercase letters, but the paths used to access them had lowercase letters. I had forgotten that Vercel uses Linux, which is case-sensitive.

I plan to improve this in future projects. For now, I focused on making it work (and apparently, it does!).



# Website Content
The project includes the following sections: About, Design, Skills, Projects, and Statistics.

- **About**: A brief story about my journey in technology and programming. I also talk about some hobbies, what Iâ€™ve been studying, and my passion for design.
- **Design**: Showcasing my thought process when creating a visual identity for an application. There are seven steps (Base, Structure, Spacing, Typography, Colorization, Visual Effects, and Animation), each demonstrated with a news-style card showing the changes.
- **Skills**: A list of languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools I work with or am currently learning.
- **Projects**: The main focus of the portfolio. This section highlights my most relevant projects with details such as date, status (active, paused, completed), tags (personal project or full-time work), additional information, some fun facts, the tech stack, and most importantly, an image of the project with links to the Figma design, GitHub repository, and live demo.
- **Statistics**: Displays interesting programming stats about me, including "Hours Coding," "Favorite Framework," and "Top Language" (most used language). Below, there is a carousel showcasing my favorite techs.



# Tech Stack
For development, I used Next.js (React) for structuring the project, TailwindCSS for styling, Framer Motion for animations, and FuseJS to implement a fuzzy search system for projects. The design was planned using Figma, and as mentioned, the deployment was done via Vercel. No database was used; all data is stored locally in JSON files.
